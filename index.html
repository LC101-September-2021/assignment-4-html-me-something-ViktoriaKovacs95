      <h1>My Teaching Experience</h1>
      <p>In 2016 I applied to be a teaching assistant in a French high school.
         Once I was accepted I flew off on an adventure of a lifetime! My teacher contract was for the entire 
         school year, during that period of time I was able to afford various trips. One of my favorite trips was the 
         weekend I spent in Paris. Overall it was a great experience and I was able to perfect my French! </p>

         <p>The weekend in Paris was truly wonderful. It was spring and the weather couldn't have been better.
            I spent the majority of the time walking around exploring all the neighbourhoods and did a bit of shopping. By the 
            end of the night I went back to the Eiffel Tower to watch it light up and grabbed a bottle of wine on the way there.

          <h5>England &amp; My First Sausage Roll</h5>
          <p> Our trip to England was generally a cold and rainy trip. But I was able to meet my roommates family. I also was able to try 
             a sausage roll that are a very popular snack in the United Kingdom.</p>
